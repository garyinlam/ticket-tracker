# Ticket Tracker

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## About

This project was created to as a ticket tracking tool to assist workflow management and compare the number of tickets completed between coworkers

The website was built using react as a component driven interface.

Each employee is stored in the team.js file as mock data and used to display each employee on the page using the map() function over the array of objects.

Each employee card has its own state and keeps track of it. These states are updated by their respective ticket counters.
